\section*{Introduction}

This guide aims to provide an overview of the CHERI compiler infrastructure.
The four chapters move down the compiler stack, describing in turn the abstract model that the compiler attempts to support, how this is exposed to the C language, how this is exposed in LLVM IR, and finally how it is represented in the target ABI.
