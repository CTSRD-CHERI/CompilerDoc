# Deprecated

This repository contains outdated information, and only for CHERI-MIPS. It has been replaced by the following documents:

- [CHERI Pure-Capability C/C++ Programming Guide] - Documents the C/C++ semantics of pure-capability code, problematic idioms and how to write clean CHERI-friendly code.

- [CHERI Hybrid C/C++ Programming Guide] - Documents the C/C++ semantics of hybrid code with reference back to the pure-capability guide. Note that hybrid code is a niche use case and should not be used without good reason.

- [CHERI ELF gABI] - Documents the CHERI extensions to the generic System V ABI.

- [CHERI ELF psABI] - Documents the CHERI extensions to the processor-specific ABIs of the underlying base architectures.
